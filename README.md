# Invoicing web app
<strong>I made this application for personal use. It's built with <a href="https://github.com/bogdanim36/ax-frmk">AxFramework</a> created also by me:</strong>
<br>  - Clone this repo: https://github.com/bogdanim36/invoicing.
<br>  - Run npm install in project folder.
<br>  - Create you MySQL date base with init-db.sql and create-table.sql.
<br>  - Create your server (IIS or apache, or. something else).
<br>  The project is still in progress....
